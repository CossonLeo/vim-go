vim-pathogen bundle for golang syntax highlighting

Ubuntu 12.04 comes with prebuilt packages for go and go syntax
highlighting and you can install go easily with

    sudo apt-get install golang

Unfortunately, the vim highlighting is not activated by default.  If you
already have got [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
you can just use following commands:

## Installation

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/geekq/vim-go.git
